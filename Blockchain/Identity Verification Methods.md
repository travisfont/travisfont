# Identity Verification Methods

## Risks of Traditional Identity Verification Methods

Traditional identity verification methods, such as physical ID checks, passwords, and knowledge-based authentication (e.g., security questions), come with several risks.

### Identity Theft & Fraud
- **Forgery & Fake IDs**: Physical documents (e.g., passports, driver’s licenses) can be counterfeited.  
- **Data Breaches**: Personal information (e.g., SSNs, birthdates) stored in databases can be stolen and used for impersonation.  

### ocial Engineering Attacks
- Attackers trick individuals or customer service reps into revealing sensitive information (e.g., phishing, pretexting).  

###Weak or Reused Passwords
- Many users rely on weak, reused, or easily guessable passwords, making accounts vulnerable to brute-force attacks.  

### Knowledge-Based Vulnerabilities
- Security questions (e.g., "What’s your mother’s maiden name?") can often be guessed or researched online.  

### Insider Threats
- Employees with access to verification systems may misuse or leak sensitive identity data.  

### Lack of Real-Time Verification
- Manual checks (e.g., in-person verification) are slow and may not catch fraudulent documents in real time.  

### Inefficiency & High Costs
- Manual verification processes are labor-intensive, slow, and expensive to maintain.  

### Privacy Concerns
- Storing excessive personal data increases risks if a breach occurs (e.g., GDPR, CCPA compliance issues).  

### Lack of Adaptability to Digital Services
- Traditional methods struggle to securely verify identities in fully online environments (e.g., remote banking, e-commerce).  

### SIM Swapping & Phone-Based Attacks
- SMS-based two-factor authentication (2FA) can be bypassed via SIM swapping or interception.  

### Mitigation Strategies

To address these risks, many organizations are adopting:  
- **Biometric authentication** (e.g., fingerprint, facial recognition)  
- **Blockchain-based digital IDs** (decentralized & tamper-proof)  
- **AI-powered document verification** (detects forged IDs in real time)  
- **Multi-factor authentication (MFA)** (combining passwords, biometrics, and hardware tokens)  
- **Zero-trust security models** (continuous identity verification)
