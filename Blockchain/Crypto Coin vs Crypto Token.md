# Crypto Coin vs Crypto Token

The main difference between a **crypto coin** and a **crypto token** lies in their underlying technology and purpose.

### **1. Crypto Coins**  
- **Native to a Blockchain**: Coins operate on their own independent blockchain (e.g., Bitcoin on Bitcoin’s blockchain, Ether on Ethereum).  
- **Primary Use Case**: Used as digital money—for payments, store of value, or transactions within their network.  
- **Examples**:  
  - Bitcoin (BTC)  
  - Ethereum (ETH)  
  - Litecoin (LTC)  

### **2. Crypto Tokens**  
- **Built on Existing Blockchains**: Tokens are created on top of another blockchain (e.g., ERC-20 tokens on Ethereum, BEP-20 on BNB Chain).  
- **Purpose**: Represent assets, utilities, or access to services (e.g., governance, DeFi, NFTs).  
- **Examples**:  
  - **Utility Tokens** (e.g., Chainlink’s LINK)  
  - **Stablecoins** (e.g., USDT, USDC)  
  - **Governance Tokens** (e.g., UNI for Uniswap)  
  - **NFTs** (Non-Fungible Tokens like CryptoPunks)  

### **Key Differences**  
| Feature       | Crypto Coin | Crypto Token |
|--------------|------------|--------------|
| **Blockchain** | Has its own | Runs on another blockchain |
| **Function**  | Currency, store of value | Utility, asset representation |
| **Creation**  | Mined or staked | Smart contracts (e.g., ERC-20) |
| **Examples**  | BTC, ETH, XRP | USDT, SHIB, APE |

### **Summary**  
- **Coins = Digital Cash** (native to a blockchain).  
- **Tokens = Digital Assets** (built on existing blockchains for specific uses).
