# Public Permissionless Blockchains Overview and Features

Public **permissionless blockchains** are decentralized, open networks where anyone can participate without needing approval from a central authority.

### **1. Open Participation**
   - **Anyone can join** – Users can read, send transactions, and participate in consensus (e.g., mining or staking) without permission.
   - **No gatekeepers** – No central entity controls who can join or validate transactions.

### **2. Decentralization & Censorship Resistance**
   - **No single point of control** – Operates on a distributed network of nodes.
   - **Censorship-resistant** – Transactions cannot be easily blocked or reversed by any single entity.

### **3. Transparency & Immutability**
   - **Public ledger** – All transactions are visible to everyone.
   - **Tamper-resistant** – Once recorded, data cannot be altered without consensus.

### **4. Native Cryptocurrency**
   - Typically has a token (e.g., Bitcoin, Ethereum) used for fees, incentives, and governance.

### **Examples of Public Permissionless Blockchains**
   - **Bitcoin (BTC)** – The first permissionless blockchain for peer-to-peer payments.
   - **Ethereum (ETH)** – Supports smart contracts and decentralized apps (DApps).
   - **Solana (SOL), Cardano (ADA), etc.** – Other open blockchains with varying features.

### **Use Cases**
   - **Decentralized Finance (DeFi)**
   - **NFTs & Digital Ownership**
   - **Open Governance (DAOs)**
   - **Trustless Payments & Remittances**

### **Trade-offs**
   - **Scalability challenges** – High usage can lead to congestion and fees.
   - **Regulatory uncertainty** – Governments may impose restrictions.
   - **Energy consumption** (for Proof-of-Work chains like Bitcoin).

Public permissionless blockchains are foundational to Web3, enabling trustless, global, and open economic systems.
