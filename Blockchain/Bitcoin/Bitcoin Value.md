# Bitcoin Value

Bitcoin derives its value from a combination of the qualities listed.

**Demand** – Bitcoin's value is driven by demand from users, investors, and institutions who see it as a store of value, medium of exchange, or speculative asset. Without demand, it would have no market price.  

**Supply** – Bitcoin has a **fixed and predictable supply** (capped at 21 million coins), which ensures that it cannot be inflated arbitrarily like fiat currencies. This controlled supply contributes to its scarcity.  

**Trust** – Bitcoin's decentralized nature, cryptographic security, and widespread adoption create trust in its network. Users believe it will retain value because of its resilience, transparency, and censorship resistance.  

**Scarcity** – Bitcoin is **programmatically scarce**, with a limited supply that mimics precious metals like gold. This scarcity enhances its perceived value over time, especially as adoption grows.  

**Utility** – Bitcoin serves practical purposes, such as enabling borderless transactions, acting as a hedge against inflation, and providing financial sovereignty in oppressive regimes. Its utility reinforces demand.  

### **Most Critical Factors:**
While all these qualities matter, **scarcity** and **demand** are the most fundamental.
Scarcity ensures Bitcoin cannot be devalued by overproduction, while demand drives its market price. **Trust** and **utility** sustain demand, and **supply** mechanisms enforce scarcity.
